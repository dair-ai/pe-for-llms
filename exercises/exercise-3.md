## Session 3 Exercises (Duration: 30 - 60 minutes)

Try to complete as many of the exercises below. Use the `demo-3.1` notebook for completing the following exercises.

1) Try to improve the performance of zero-shot prompting for the emotion classification task based on the techniques we learned in the previous sessions.

2) Implement a few-shot prompting approach and perform a performance comparison with the finetuned models and other prompting techniques. Try to see if you can close the performance gap between the finetuned model. 

3) Besides the prompting techniques, use different models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` (if you have access). Compare the results from those models to your finetuned model and across different prompting techniques.
