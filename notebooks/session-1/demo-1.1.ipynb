In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use.\n",

Black holes are regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways, a black hole acts like an idealized black body, as it reflects no light."
